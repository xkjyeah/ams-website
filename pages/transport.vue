        <blockquote>
          “The two Indian gentlemen who came by to transport my wife to TTSH displayed high standards of professionalism and care in their work. They carefully evaluated my wife’s physical condition before deciding how best to move her down the stairs. My wife
          is thankful for their consideration in making her as comfortable as they can.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “I am writing to thank you for the arrangement to evacuate my wife back to Singapore after her accident in Batam. This is the first time we have to activate an emergency service from overseas… I would also like to compliment Ambulance Medical Service (AMS) for their swift action and attention to details, in particular Mr Mahmod who came from Singapore to Batam to personally ensure that everything was prepared accordingly for my wife's safe return to Singapore. He also texted me after to ask for update about her well-being at the hospital”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “I’d like to compliment 2 AMS staff on their service. I was a medical escort for a patient and we were picked up at NUH by Syakira and Farhan. They were not only efficient but also really attentive to her safety and comfort throughout the journey. Although there were minor inconveniences due to the size of my patient’s wheelchair, they were patient and showed no sign of annoyance. They helped to hold the seatbelt away from my patient’s neck throughout the entire journey when she found it uncomfortable. From time to time they asked my patient if she was comfortable and it was really heartwarming to know that they go the extra mile from what is required of them. I’m a nurse and witnessing how dedicated their service was to their patients is a really timely reminder about how I treat my own patients too. Thank you so much!”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “I would like to extend my appreciation towards two of your ambulance officers for the special dedicated services this afternoon. They were very caring, full of passion and patient towards my elderly mother. While waiting for the doctor, Meeran accompanied and handled my mother with care throughout the whole process. My mom felt very comfortable and secure even with a stranger like Meeran. I would also like to thank the lady officer Mala – she was helpful and friendly over the phone.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “I have used your services twice for my 96 year old mother in law. I wish to highly applaud the excellent service provided by your driver Tony on both occasions. Tony was careful and friendly in handling the situation, keeping my mother in law calm (she even kissed him). Knowing my anxiety, Tony kept me in a conversation to lighten my worries and kept assuring me that my mother in law will be fine. Later he even stayed and accompanied me until a doctor could see her. Such service is rare nowadays.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          &ldquo;I have used your AMS service twice so far and are very pleased with your staff. Bernard is always helpful, courteous and professional and also an honest employee. He is also very patient with the elderly and willing to consider suggestions. Both he and Jamil made our journey pleasant and stress-free.&rdquo;
